# Cybersecurity-Project-2: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Rekall Corporation's Web Application, Linux Servers, and Windows Servers

LOM was authorized by the fictional Rekall Corporation to conduct a vulnerability assessment of Rekall's web application, Linux machine, and Windows machine. Below shows my vulnerability findings for the project.
