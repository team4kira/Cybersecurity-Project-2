# Cybersecurity-Project-2: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Rekall Corporation's Web Application, Linux Servers, and Windows Servers
For this cybersecurity project, I developed a hypothetical company named L'Ordinateur de la Maison (LOM), which was granted authorization by the fictional Rekall Corporation to assess vulnerablilities in Rekall's web application, Linux Machine, and Windows Machine. The attached PDF file details the findings of this assessmnet.
